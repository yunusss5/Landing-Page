                    <summary>Level 1 (<span>Physically</span> )</summary>
                    <p>Physically mentorship, or physical mentorship, is a form of guidance and support where a mentor works closely with a mentee in person, engaging in activities, demonstrations, and direct interactions to help the mentee develop specific skills or achieve certain goals. Unlike remote or digital mentorship, physically mentorship often involves hands-on experiences, observation, and immediate feedback, which can enhance learning and skill acquisition. This type of mentorship is common in various fields such as sports, arts, trades, and academia, where physical presence and direct engagement are essential for effective learning and development.</p>

                    <summary>Level 2 (<span>Career</span> )</summary>
                    <p>Career mentorship is a professional relationship where an experienced individual guides and supports a less experienced person in their career development and advancement. Mentors offer advice, share knowledge, provide feedback, and help mentees navigate challenges and opportunities within their chosen field. This form of mentorship aims to enhance skills, expand networks, and foster personal and professional growth, ultimately helping mentees achieve their career goals. Career mentorship can take various forms, including one-on-one meetings, group sessions, and informal networking, and it plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' career trajectories and success.</p>

                    <summary>Level 3 (<span>Mentally & Physically</span> )</summary>
                    <p>Mentally and physically mentorship combines guidance for both mental and physical aspects of personal development. Mentors provide support and advice not only for enhancing skills and achieving goals but also for nurturing mental well-being and physical health. This holistic approach recognizes the interconnectedness of mental and physical wellness in achieving overall success and fulfillment. Mentors in this context may offer strategies for stress management, resilience building, and self-care alongside guidance on skill acquisition and goal setting. Through a balanced focus on mental and physical aspects, this mentorship aims to empower individuals to thrive in both their personal and professional lives.</p>
